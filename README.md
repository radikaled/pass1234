# Pass1234

Pass1234 is a password-sharing application written in Python that utilizes the Flask micro web framework. It is designed to securely store and share passwords by employing AES-CBC 256-bit encryption to protect sensitive data, with PBKDF2 SHA-256 used to derive the encryption key for added security.
